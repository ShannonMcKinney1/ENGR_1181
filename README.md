Matlab Battleship with a smart AI

To Play:
Download files and import them into MATLAB
Run BattleshipMain.m
Your board is the left side, the computer's is the right side
Place your ships by clicking either the top-most or left-most square first of where you would like to place it
Leave the correct amount of spaces before clicking again to place the "endcap" of the ship
You should have 5 ships (1 "two", 2 "threes", 1 "four", 1 "five")
On turn 10, you get a 3x3 power up! When you click, a 3x3 square of shots will appear! (your initial click is the top left of the square it will create)
On turn 15, you get a double shot! You get two turns before the computer can take another turn
Play ends when either the computer or the player finds all of the ships!
Click on the right side to place your shots, red shots mean a hit, white shots mean a miss
